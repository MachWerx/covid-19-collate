# covid-19-collate

A Python 3 script to collate the data from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.git
into individual state and county data.

If you've cloned the NY Times repo in a parallel directory to this one and it
has the default directory name, you can just run ./collate.py to regenerate the
state data files.
